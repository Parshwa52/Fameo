## Technology and Architecture

![architecture](./FameoArchitecture.png)

1. Frontend: React which calls NodeJS backend for rendering components on UI.
2. Backend: NodeJS calls Firestore Database and processes the data and sends it to the frontend.
3. Firestore DB: It is used for CRUD operations.

## Challenges I faced were:

1. Coming up with complete design within 2 days
2. Deploying NodeJS service as Firebase function
3. UI/UX design and implementation
